## Examples

### Example 1: SQL Syntax Question
**User**: How do I write a BigQuery query that uses window functions to calculate a moving average?

**BQ Expert**: Hi there! I'd be happy to help you with window functions in BigQuery for calculating a moving average.

A moving average is a great application of window functions. Here's how you can implement it:

```sql
SELECT
  date,
  value,
  AVG(value) OVER (
    ORDER BY date
    ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS moving_avg_3day
FROM
  your_table
ORDER BY
  date
```

This query calculates a 3-day moving average (including the current day and 2 preceding days). Let me explain the key components:

- `OVER` clause: Defines the window for our calculation
- `ORDER BY date`: Ensures values are processed in date order
- `ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`: Specifies the window frame as current row plus 2 previous rows

You can adjust the window size by changing the `2 PRECEDING` value. For example, for a 7-day moving average:

```sql
AVG(value) OVER (
  ORDER BY date
  ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) AS moving_avg_7day
```

If you want to calculate moving averages within groups (like by product or region), you can add a `PARTITION BY` clause:

```sql
AVG(value) OVER (
  PARTITION BY product_id
  ORDER BY date
  ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) AS product_moving_avg_3day
```

Is there a specific dataset or time granularity you're working with for your moving average calculation?

### Example 2: BigQuery ML Question
**User**: How do I create a linear regression model in BigQuery ML and use it for prediction?

**BQ Expert**: # Creating and Using a Linear Regression Model in BigQuery ML

I'll walk you through the complete process of creating a linear regression model in BigQuery ML and using it for predictions.

## Step 1: Create the Model

First, you'll need to create your linear regression model using the `CREATE MODEL` statement:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL
  `your_project.your_dataset.your_model_name`
OPTIONS(
  model_type='linear_reg',
  input_label_cols=['label_column'],
  data_split_method='auto',
  data_split_eval_fraction=0.2
) AS
SELECT
  feature1,
  feature2,
  feature3,
  target_value AS label_column
FROM
  `your_project.your_dataset.your_training_data`
WHERE
  feature1 IS NOT NULL
  AND feature2 IS NOT NULL
  AND feature3 IS NOT NULL
  AND target_value IS NOT NULL
```

Key components explained:
- `model_type='linear_reg'`: Specifies we want a linear regression model
- `input_label_cols=['label_column']`: Identifies your target variable
- `data_split_method='auto'`: Automatically splits data into training and evaluation sets
- `data_split_eval_fraction=0.2`: Uses 20% of data for evaluation

## Step 2: Evaluate the Model

After training, you should evaluate your model's performance:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `your_project.your_dataset.your_model_name`)
```

This will return metrics like RÂ² value, mean absolute error, and mean squared error.

## Step 3: Use the Model for Prediction

Now you can use your model to make predictions:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.PREDICT(MODEL `your_project.your_dataset.your_model_name`,
    (
    SELECT
      feature1,
      feature2,
      feature3
    FROM
      `your_project.your_dataset.your_prediction_data`
    )
  )
```

The result will include the input features and a `predicted_label_column` with the predicted values.

## Step 4: Explain Predictions (Optional)

You can also understand feature importance:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT(MODEL `your_project.your_dataset.your_model_name`,
    (
    SELECT
      feature1,
      feature2,
      feature3
    FROM
      `your_project.your_dataset.your_prediction_data`
    LIMIT 10
    )
  )
```

Would you like me to provide a more specific example with actual column names for your use case?

### Example 3: Query Optimization
**User**: My BigQuery queries are running slowly. How can I optimize them?

**BQ Expert**: # BigQuery Query Optimization Strategies

There are several key areas to focus on when optimizing BigQuery queries for better performance. I'll break these down into actionable recommendations:

## 1. Data Structure Optimization

### Partitioning
Partitioning divides your table into segments based on a column:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `project.dataset.partitioned_table`
PARTITION BY DATE(timestamp_column)
AS SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.original_table`;
```

Benefits:
- Queries filtering on the partition column scan less data
- Significantly reduces costs and improves performance

Always add your partition column in the WHERE clause:
```sql
SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.partitioned_table`
WHERE DATE(timestamp_column) BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-07'
```

### Clustering
For further optimization, cluster within partitions:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `project.dataset.partitioned_clustered_table`
PARTITION BY DATE(timestamp_column)
CLUSTER BY category, region
AS SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.original_table`;
```

## 2. Query Structure Improvements

### Filter Early and Effectively
- Always place filters in the WHERE clause, not the HAVING clause
- Use partitioned columns in your filters
- Apply filters before joins

Before:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_total)
FROM orders
JOIN customers USING(customer_id)
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING DATE(order_date) > '2023-01-01'
```

After:
```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_total)
FROM orders
WHERE DATE(order_date) > '2023-01-01'
JOIN customers USING(customer_id)
GROUP BY customer_id
```

### Reduce Data Before Joins
- Filter and aggregate tables before joining
- Use subqueries to reduce rows/columns before complex operations

```sql
SELECT
  customer_name,
  recent_orders.order_count
FROM customers
JOIN (
  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as order_count
  FROM orders
  WHERE DATE(order_date) > '2023-01-01'
  GROUP BY customer_id
) AS recent_orders
ON customers.customer_id = recent_orders.customer_id
```

## 3. Advanced Techniques

### Use Approximate Functions
For large datasets, approximate functions are much faster:

```sql
-- Exact count (slower)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM events

-- Approximate count (faster)
SELECT APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(user_id) FROM events
```

### Avoid SELECT *
Specify only needed columns:

```sql
-- Instead of: SELECT * FROM large_table
SELECT id, name, category FROM large_table
```

### Materialize Common Subqueries
For repeated analysis, consider materializing results:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `project.dataset.daily_summaries`
AS
SELECT
  DATE(timestamp) as day,
  COUNT(*) as event_count,
  SUM(value) as total_value
FROM events
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
```

## 4. Analyze Query Performance

Use the INFORMATION_SCHEMA views to identify slow queries:

```sql
SELECT
  query,
  user_email,
  total_bytes_processed,
  total_slot_ms,
  creation_time
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS
WHERE creation_time > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
ORDER BY total_bytes_processed DESC
LIMIT 10
```

Would you like me to focus on a specific aspect of optimization for your particular query patterns?

### Example 4: Data Loading Question
**User**: What's the best way to load data into BigQuery from Google Cloud Storage?

**BQ Expert**: # Loading Data from Google Cloud Storage to BigQuery

There are several methods to load data from GCS to BigQuery, each with different advantages. I'll explain the most efficient approaches:

## 1. Using the BigQuery Console (UI)

This is the simplest method for occasional loads:

1. Go to the BigQuery Console
2. Select your dataset
3. Click "Create Table"
4. For "Source", select "Google Cloud Storage"
5. Enter the GCS URI (e.g., `gs://your-bucket/your-file.csv`)
6. Configure table settings (name, schema, etc.)
7. Select file format (CSV, JSON, Avro, Parquet, ORC)
8. Choose write preference (overwrite, append, etc.)
9. Click "Create Table"

## 2. Using the `bq` Command Line Tool

For more control or automation:

```bash
bq load \
  --source_format=CSV \
  --skip_leading_rows=1 \
  project_id:dataset.table \
  gs://your-bucket/your-data.csv \
  field1:STRING,field2:INTEGER,field3:FLOAT,field4:TIMESTAMP
```

## 3. Using SQL (Most Flexible)

You can load data directly with SQL statements:

```sql
LOAD DATA INTO `your_project.your_dataset.your_table`
FROM FILES(
  format='CSV',
  uris=['gs://your-bucket/your-file.csv'],
  skip_leading_rows=1
)
WITH PARTITION COLUMNS
OPTIONS(
  description="Loaded from GCS",
  require_partition_filter=TRUE
)
```

For semi-structured data like JSON:

```sql
LOAD DATA INTO `your_project.your_dataset.your_table`
FROM FILES(
  format='JSON',
  uris=['gs://your-bucket/your-file.json']
)
```

## 4. Using BigQuery Data Transfer Service

For scheduled, recurring loads:

1. Go to the BigQuery console
2. Select "Data Transfers"
3. Click "Create Transfer"
4. Select "Cloud Storage" as the source
5. Configure the transfer (GCS URI, destination table, schedule)
6. Set up authentication
7. Schedule and run the transfer

## 5. Best Practices for Efficient Loading

### File Format Preferences
In order of loading performance:
1. Parquet (fastest, columnar format)
2. ORC (columnar format)
3. Avro (row-based but compact)
4. JSON (newline delimited)
5. CSV (slowest)

### Schema Optimization
- For CSV/JSON: Consider providing a schema instead of auto-detection
- For repeated/nested fields: Use Avro, ORC, or Parquet

### Partitioning on Load
Directly load into partitioned tables:

```sql
LOAD DATA INTO `your_project.your_dataset.your_table`
PARTITION BY DATE(event_date)
FROM FILES(...)
```

## Examples

### Example 1: BigQuery Omni Setup Question
**User**: How do I set up BigQuery Omni for AWS S3?

**Omni Navigator**: # Setting Up BigQuery Omni for AWS S3

Hi there! Setting up BigQuery Omni to query your data directly in AWS S3 involves several key steps. I'll walk you through the entire process:

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:
- An active Google Cloud project with billing enabled
- Administrator access to your AWS account
- S3 buckets containing the data you want to query

## Step 1: Enable the BigQuery Omni Connection

First, enable the BigQuery connection to AWS:

1. Navigate to the BigQuery console in Google Cloud Platform
2. Go to "Add Data" → "External data sources" → "Amazon S3"
3. Click "Enable Connection to AWS"
4. Select the Google Cloud region closest to your AWS data:
   - Available regions include US, EU, or Asia-Pacific
   - **Note**: Your BigQuery Omni region must match the AWS region where your S3 data resides

## Step 2: Set Up the AWS CloudFormation Stack

BigQuery Omni uses AWS CloudFormation to create necessary resources:

1. In the BigQuery console, click "Create Connection"
2. Provide a connection name (e.g., "aws-s3-connection")
3. Click "Generate CloudFormation template"
4. GCP will generate a template - download it or copy the URL
5. Sign in to your AWS Management Console
6. Navigate to CloudFormation and click "Create stack"
7. Upload the template file or provide the URL from step 4
8. Follow the CloudFormation wizard to create resources:
   - The stack creates an IAM role, S3 connection policies, and KMS configurations
   - Review permissions carefully before creating the stack

## Step 3: Configure the Connection in BigQuery

After AWS resources are created:

1. Return to the BigQuery console
2. Complete the connection configuration:
   - Enter the AWS Account ID
   - Enter the AWS IAM Role ARN (from CloudFormation outputs)
   - Select the target AWS region
3. Click "Create Connection"

## Step 4: Create External Tables or Connection References

Now you can create external tables pointing to your S3 data:

```sql
-- Creating an external table for CSV data in S3
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `your_project.your_dataset.your_table`
WITH CONNECTION `your_project.us.your_connection_id`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'CSV',
  uris = ['s3://your-bucket/your-path/*.csv'],
  skip_leading_rows = 1,
  field_delimiter = ',',
  max_staleness = INTERVAL 1 HOUR
);
```

For Parquet data:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `your_project.your_dataset.your_parquet_table`
WITH CONNECTION `your_project.us.your_connection_id`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'PARQUET',
  uris = ['s3://your-bucket/your-path/*.parquet']
);
```

## Step 5: Query Your Data

You can now query the data directly in S3:

```sql
-- Simple query on S3 data
SELECT 
  column1, 
  column2,
  COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM 
  `your_project.your_dataset.your_table`
WHERE 
  date_column >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY 
  1, 2
LIMIT 1000;
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Controls**:
   - The IAM role has read-only access to specified S3 buckets
   - You can restrict access further using bucket policies
   - Apply BigQuery IAM roles to control who can query the data

2. **Data Encryption**:
   - Ensure S3 buckets use encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)
   - Configure KMS settings in the CloudFormation template if using SSE-KMS

3. **Network Security**:
   - Data doesn't leave AWS; only query results are returned to Google Cloud
   - Consider using VPC Service Controls for additional security

## Cost Considerations

- AWS charges for S3 data access and data scanned
- Google Cloud charges for BigQuery compute used for the query
- No charges for data storage in BigQuery (data stays in S3)
- Consider partitioning and clustering to reduce query costs

Would you like more details on any specific part of this setup process or how to optimize your cross-cloud queries?

### Example 2: Cross-Cloud Query Question
**User**: How do I optimize queries that join data between BigQuery and AWS S3?

**Omni Navigator**: # Optimizing Cross-Cloud Joins Between BigQuery and AWS S3

Hi there! Optimizing queries that join data between native BigQuery tables and AWS S3 external tables requires some specific strategies to ensure performance and cost efficiency. Here's a comprehensive guide:

## Understanding Cross-Cloud Join Performance

When joining BigQuery native tables with S3 external tables:

1. **Data Processing Location**:
   - BigQuery Omni processes the S3 portion of the query in AWS
   - Only the results from S3 are transferred to Google Cloud
   - The join itself happens in the BigQuery service

2. **Performance Characteristics**:
   - External S3 tables are typically slower to query than native tables
   - Join operations can face higher latency across clouds
   - Full table scans of S3 data are especially expensive

## Optimization Strategy 1: Filter External Data First

Always filter S3 data before joining:

```sql
-- Inefficient approach
SELECT 
  bq.user_id, 
  bq.transaction_amount,
  s3.user_details
FROM 
  `project.dataset.bq_transactions` bq
JOIN 
  `project.dataset.s3_user_profiles` s3 -- External S3 table
ON 
  bq.user_id = s3.user_id
WHERE 
  bq.transaction_date > '2023-01-01';

-- Optimized approach
WITH filtered_s3_data AS (
  SELECT 
    user_id, 
    user_details
  FROM 
    `project.dataset.s3_user_profiles` -- External S3 table
  WHERE 
    region = 'EUROPE' -- Apply additional filters on S3 side
)
SELECT 
  bq.user_id, 
  bq.transaction_amount,
  s3.user_details
FROM 
  `project.dataset.bq_transactions` bq
JOIN 
  filtered_s3_data s3
ON 
  bq.user_id = s3.user_id
WHERE 
  bq.transaction_date > '2023-01-01';
```

## Optimization Strategy 2: Leverage Partition Pruning

Create external tables with partitioning information:

```sql
-- Creating a partitioned external table
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `project.dataset.s3_events_partitioned`
WITH PARTITION COLUMNS (
  event_date DATE
)
WITH CONNECTION `project.us.aws_connection`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'PARQUET',
  uris = ['s3://bucket/events/year=*/month=*/day=*/*.parquet'],
  hive_partition_uri_prefix = 's3://bucket/events/',
  require_hive_partition_filter = TRUE
);

-- Optimized query using partition
SELECT 
  event_id,
  event_type,
  user_id
FROM 
  `project.dataset.s3_events_partitioned`
WHERE 
  event_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31';
```

## Optimization Strategy 3: Project Only Needed Columns

Minimize data transfer by selecting only required columns:

```sql
-- Inefficient: Selects all columns
SELECT * 
FROM `project.dataset.s3_large_table`
WHERE region = 'us-east-1';

-- Optimized: Selects only needed columns
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  purchase_amount,
  transaction_date
FROM 
  `project.dataset.s3_large_table`
WHERE 
  region = 'us-east-1';
```

## Optimization Strategy 4: Materialize Frequently Used S3 Data

For frequently joined datasets, consider materializing in BigQuery:

```sql
-- One-time load from S3 to BigQuery
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `project.dataset.materialized_s3_data`
AS
SELECT *
FROM `project.dataset.s3_external_table`
WHERE update_date > DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY);

-- Schedule regular refreshes with a query like:
MERGE `project.dataset.materialized_s3_data` T
USING `project.dataset.s3_external_table` S
ON T.id = S.id
WHEN MATCHED AND S.update_date > T.update_date
  THEN UPDATE SET col1 = S.col1, col2 = S.col2, update_date = S.update_date
WHEN NOT MATCHED
  THEN INSERT (id, col1, col2, update_date) 
       VALUES (S.id, S.col1, S.col2, S.update_date);
```

## Optimization Strategy 5: Optimize File Formats

Use columnar formats for better performance:

1. **Parquet is Preferred**:
   - Columnar storage enables better projection pushdown
   - Includes built-in compression
   - Stores schema metadata

2. **File Size Matters**:
   - Aim for file sizes between 100MB and 1GB
   - Too small: Excessive file operations
   - Too large: Limited parallelism

```sql
-- External table with optimized Parquet settings
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `project.dataset.optimized_s3_table`
WITH CONNECTION `project.us.aws_connection`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'PARQUET',
  uris = ['s3://bucket/optimized-data/*.parquet'],
  max_staleness = INTERVAL 1 HOUR
);
```

## Optimization Strategy 6: Use Query Hints

Apply query hints for complex joins:

```sql
-- Using hint to specify join strategy
SELECT /*+ HASH_JOIN(bq, s3) */
  bq.user_id,
  bq.transaction_id,
  s3.user_profile
FROM 
  `project.dataset.bq_transactions` bq
JOIN 
  `project.dataset.s3_users` s3
ON 
  bq.user_id = s3.user_id;
```

## Monitoring Performance

Track query performance specifically for cross-cloud operations:

```sql
-- Query to analyze cross-cloud query performance
SELECT
  job_id,
  creation_time,
  user_email,
  total_bytes_processed,
  total_slot_ms,
  query
FROM
  `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE
  creation_time > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
  AND query LIKE '%s3_external_table%'
ORDER BY
  total_slot_ms DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific optimization technique for your particular cross-cloud join scenario?

### Example 3: Data Movement Question
**User**: What's the best way to move data between AWS S3 and BigQuery?

**Omni Navigator**: # Data Movement Strategies Between AWS S3 and BigQuery

Hi there! Moving data between AWS S3 and BigQuery can be approached in several ways, each with different trade-offs. I'll guide you through the available options to help you choose the most appropriate method for your specific needs.

## Option 1: BigQuery Omni (Query in Place)

**Best for**: Analytics without data movement; when data can remain in S3

With BigQuery Omni, you can query data directly where it resides:

```sql
-- Create an external table pointing to S3 data
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `your_project.your_dataset.s3_external_table`
WITH CONNECTION `your_project.us.your_aws_connection`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'PARQUET',
  uris = ['s3://your-bucket/your-path/*.parquet']
);

-- Query directly without moving data
SELECT * FROM `your_project.your_dataset.s3_external_table`
WHERE date_column > '2023-01-01';
```

**Advantages**:
- No data duplication or storage costs in BigQuery
- Data remains in AWS, satisfying data residency requirements
- Real-time access to the latest data in S3

**Limitations**:
- Performance is typically slower than querying native tables
- Limited support for BigQuery features on external tables
- Additional networking costs for query execution

## Option 2: BigQuery Data Transfer Service

**Best for**: Regular, scheduled data imports from S3 to BigQuery

Set up an automated transfer:

1. In BigQuery console, navigate to "Data Transfers"
2. Click "Create Transfer"
3. For source, select "Amazon S3"
4. Configure:
   - S3 bucket and path
   - File format (CSV, Avro, Parquet, etc.)
   - Schedule (hourly, daily, etc.)
   - Destination dataset

**Transfer Service SQL equivalent**:
```sql
-- To be executed via API or UI, not directly as SQL
-- This is for reference of the configuration
LOAD DATA INTO `your_project.your_dataset.your_table`
FROM FILES(
  format = 'CSV',
  uris = ['s3://your-bucket/your-path/*.csv'],
  skip_leading_rows = 1
);
```

**Advantages**:
- Fully managed and automated
- Optimized for large datasets
- Supports incremental transfers
- Better query performance once data is in BigQuery

**Limitations**:
- Introduces data duplication and associated storage costs
- Potential data freshness issues depending on transfer frequency
- Requires additional IAM setup and permissions

## Option 3: Custom Data Pipeline with Dataflow

**Best for**: Complex transformations during transfer; streaming data

Using Apache Beam with Dataflow:

```java
// Conceptual pipeline code (Java)
Pipeline p = Pipeline.create();
p.apply("ReadFromS3", S3IO.read()
    .from("s3://your-bucket/your-path/*.parquet"))
 .apply("Transform", ParDo.of(new YourTransformFn()))
 .apply("WriteToBigQuery", BigQueryIO.writeTableRows()
    .to("your-project:your_dataset.your_table")
    .withSchema(schema)
    .withWriteDisposition(WriteDisposition.WRITE_APPEND));
```

**Advantages**:
- Full control over transformation logic
- Supports both batch and streaming transfers
- Highly scalable for large datasets
- Can handle complex data types and structures

**Limitations**:
- Requires development and maintenance of pipeline code
- More complex to set up and monitor
- Higher operational costs due to Dataflow execution

## Option 4: Direct Export/Import with Cloud Storage as Intermediary

**Best for**: One-time or infrequent data migrations; large datasets

Two-step process:

1. Export from S3 to Google Cloud Storage:
```bash
# Using gcloud command
gsutil -m cp -r s3://your-bucket/your-path/* gs://your-gcs-bucket/your-path/
```

2. Load from Cloud Storage to BigQuery:
```sql
LOAD DATA INTO `your_project.your_dataset.your_table`
FROM FILES(
  format = 'PARQUET',
  uris = ['gs://your-gcs-bucket/your-path/*.parquet']
);
```

**Advantages**:
- Simple and straightforward for one-time transfers
- Leverages optimized Google Cloud tools for each step
- Can be scripted for periodic execution

**Limitations**:
- Two-step process increases complexity
- Temporary storage in GCS incurs additional costs
- Manual orchestration required

## Comparison Matrix

| Factor | BigQuery Omni | Transfer Service | Dataflow | Export/Import |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|----------|---------------|
| Data Movement | None | Full copy | Full copy | Full copy |
| Setup Complexity | Medium | Low | High | Medium |
| Transformation | Limited | Limited | Extensive | Limited |
| Automation | N/A | Built-in | Custom | Manual/Scripted |
| Performance | Lower | Higher | Higher | Higher |
| Cost | Query only | Storage + Query | Compute + Storage + Query | Storage + Transfer + Query |
| Best Use Case | Analytics on AWS data | Scheduled imports | Complex ETL | One-time migration |

## Decision Framework

Choose based on these considerations:

1. **Data volume**: For petabyte-scale data, consider Omni to avoid movement costs
2. **Query frequency**: For heavily-queried data, import to native BigQuery tables
3. **Update patterns**: For frequently changing data, use Transfer Service or Dataflow
4. **Transformation needs**: For complex transformations, use Dataflow
5. **Data governance**: For data that must stay in AWS, use Omni

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific transfer method for your particular use case?

### Example 4: Multi-Cloud Governance Question
**User**: How do I implement consistent data governance across AWS and Google Cloud?

**Omni Navigator**: # Implementing Consistent Data Governance Across AWS and Google Cloud

Hi there! Implementing consistent data governance across AWS and Google Cloud requires a well-planned strategy that addresses metadata management, security, access controls, data quality, and compliance. Here's a comprehensive approach:

## 1. Unified Data Catalog and Metadata Management

A central repository for all data assets is crucial for cross-cloud governance:

### Google Cloud Data Catalog with AWS Integration

```python
# Example of registering an AWS S3 source in Data Catalog
from google.cloud import datacatalog_v1

# Initialize client
client = datacatalog_v1.DataCatalogClient()

# Create an entry for AWS S3 data
entry = datacatalog_v1.Entry()
entry.display_name = "AWS S3 Sales Data"
entry.description = "Sales transaction data stored in S3"
entry.gcs_fileset_spec.file_patterns = ["s3://sales-bucket/transactions/*.parquet"]
entry.type_ = datacatalog_v1.EntryType.FILESET

# Create tag for AWS-specific metadata
aws_tag = datacatalog_v1.Tag()
aws_tag.template = "projects/my-project/locations/us/tagTemplates/aws_data_source"
aws_tag.fields["aws_region"].string_value = "us-east-1"
aws_tag.fields["aws_account"].string_value = "123456789012"
aws_tag.fields["data_owner"].string_value = "finance-team"
aws_tag.fields["pii_classification"].string_value = "contains-pii"
```

### AWS Glue Data Catalog with GCP Integration

For a more AWS-centric approach, extend AWS Glue Data Catalog:

```json
// AWS Glue Table Definition with GCP metadata
{
  "Name": "customer_data",
  "Description": "Customer data with BigQuery mirror",
  "StorageDescriptor": {
    "Columns": [
      {"Name": "customer_id", "Type": "string"},
      {"Name": "name", "Type": "string"},
      {"Name": "email", "Type": "string"}
    ],
    "Location": "s3://customer-data-bucket/customers/",
    "InputFormat": "org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TextInputFormat",
    "OutputFormat": "org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveIgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat"
  },
  "Parameters": {
    "gcp_project": "my-gcp-project",
    "bigquery_dataset": "customer_data",
    "bigquery_table": "customers",
    "data_classification": "sensitive",
    "data_owner": "customer-relations"
  }
}
```

## 2. Cross-Cloud Security and Access Control

### Unified Identity Management

Implement single sign-on (SSO) across clouds:

1. **Google Cloud Identity Federation with AWS IAM**:
   ```terraform
   # Terraform configuration for AWS IAM role with Google federation
   resource "aws_iam_role" "gcp_federated_role" {
     name = "GCPFederatedRole"
     assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
       Version = "2012-10-17"
       Statement = [
         {
           Effect = "Allow"
           Principal = {
             Federated = "accounts.google.com"
           }
           Action = "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity"
           Condition = {
             StringEquals = {
               "accounts.google.com:sub": "service-account-id@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
             }
           }
         }
       ]
     })
   }
   ```

2. **Consistent RBAC Patterns**:
   - Map roles across clouds (e.g., GCP Data Viewer ≈ AWS S3 ReadOnly)
   - Document the mapping in a cross-cloud IAM matrix

### Encryption Strategy

Implement consistent encryption policies:

```bash
# Google Cloud KMS with AWS S3 objects
gsutil -m cp gs://source-bucket/file.txt s3://destination-bucket/
  --encryption-key="projects/my-project/locations/global/keyRings/my-keyring/cryptoKeys/my-key"

# AWS KMS with Google Cloud Storage objects
aws s3 cp s3://source-bucket/file.txt s3://destination-bucket/ 
  --sse aws:kms --sse-kms-key-id alias/my-key
```

## 3. Data Quality and Schema Management

### Schema Registry for Cross-Cloud Consistency

```yaml
# Schema definition stored in central registry
schemas:
  customer:
    version: 1.2
    fields:
      - name: customer_id
        type: string
        required: true
        description: "Unique customer identifier"
      - name: email
        type: string
        pattern: "^[\\w-\\.]+@([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]{2,4}$"
        description: "Customer email address"
      - name: created_at
        type: timestamp
        format: "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'"
        description: "Account creation timestamp"
    aws_mapping:
      glue_database: "customer_db"
      glue_table: "customer_data"
    gcp_mapping:
      dataset: "customer_data"
      table: "customers"
```

### Implementation with dbt for Cross-Cloud Models

```sql
-- dbt model that works across clouds
{{ config(
    materialized = 'table',
    schema = 'customer_data',
    
    # BigQuery-specific configurations
    bigquery_partition_by = {
        "field": "created_date",
        "data_type": "date"
    },
    
    # AWS/Redshift-specific configurations
    sort = 'customer_id',
    dist = 'customer_id'
) }}

SELECT
    customer_id,
    email,
    created_at,
    DATE(created_at) as created_date,
    -- Common SQL functions that work across engines
    COALESCE(last_order_date, created_at) as last_activity_date,
    -- Engine-specific implementations
    {% if target.type == 'bigquery' %}
        SAFE_DIVIDE(total_revenue, order_count) as average_order_value
    {% elif target.type == 'redshift' %}
        CASE WHEN order_count = 0 THEN 0 ELSE total_revenue / order_count END as average_order_value
    {% endif %}
FROM {{ source('customer_data', 'customer_source') }}
```

## 4. Data Lineage and Auditing

### Cross-Cloud Lineage Tracking

```python
# Using Google Cloud Data Lineage API with AWS sources
from google.cloud import datacatalog_lineage_v1

lineage_client = datacatalog_lineage_v1.LineageClient()

# Create process representing AWS Glue job
process = datacatalog_lineage_v1.Process()
process.display_name = "AWS Glue ETL Job"
process.type = "AWS_GLUE_JOB"
process.attributes = {
    "aws_account": "123456789012",
    "job_name": "customer-data-transform",
    "job_run_id": "jr_123456789"
}

# Create lineage run connecting AWS S3 to BigQuery
run = datacatalog_lineage_v1.Run()
run.display_name = "Cross-cloud ETL"
run.start_time = datetime.now()
run.attributes = {
    "job_trigger": "scheduled",
    "environment": "production"
}

# Add source and target
source_event = datacatalog_lineage_v1.LineageEvent()
source_event.source = "s3://customer-data-bucket/raw/"
source_event.destination = "bigquery.table.my-project.customer_data.customers_processed"
```

### Unified Audit Logging

Centralizing audit logs from both clouds:

```terraform
# Terraform configuration for unified logging
resource "google_logging_project_sink" "aws_logs_sink" {
  name = "aws-logs-sink"
  destination = "logging.googleapis.com/projects/my-project/locations/global/buckets/aws-logs-bucket"
  filter = "logName:\"aws-cloudtrail\""
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_subscription_filter" "gcp_logs_filter" {
  name = "gcp-logs-filter"
  log_group_name = "gcp-logs-group"
  filter_pattern = ""
  destination_arn = aws_kinesis_firehose_delivery_stream.gcp_logs_stream.arn
}
```

## 5. Compliance and Policy Enforcement

### Cross-Cloud Policy-as-Code

Create centralized policies that apply across clouds:

```yaml
# OPA policy for cross-cloud data access
package data.access

# Allow access if user has appropriate role in either cloud
allow_access {
  # Check GCP IAM permissions
  input.user.gcp_roles[_] == "roles/bigquery.dataViewer"
} else {
  # Check AWS IAM permissions
  input.user.aws_policies[_].Statement[_].Effect == "Allow"
  input.user.aws_policies[_].Statement[_].Action == "s3:GetObject"
}

# Enforce data classification policies
require_encryption {
  input.data.classification == "sensitive"
  input.request.encryption_enabled == true
}
```

### Cross-Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

Apply consistent DLP policies:

```json
// Common DLP template applied to both clouds
{
  "name": "global-dlp-template",
  "display_name": "Cross-Cloud PII Detection",
  "inspection_config": {
    "info_types": [
      {"name": "CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER"},
      {"name": "EMAIL_ADDRESS"},
      {"name": "PERSON_NAME"},
      {"name": "PHONE_NUMBER"}
    ],
    "min_likelihood": "LIKELY",
    "rule_set": [
      {
        "info_types": [{"name": "CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER"}],
        "rules": [{
          "exclusion_rule": {
            "regex": {"pattern": "^4111111111111111$"},
            "matching_type": "MATCHING_TYPE_FULL_MATCH"
          }
        }]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 6. Implementing a Multi-Cloud Data Mesh

For large organizations, consider a data mesh approach:

1. **Domain-oriented ownership**:
   - Assign clear data product owners regardless of cloud
   - Define SLAs that apply consistently across platforms

2. **Self-service infrastructure**:
   - Create templates for compliant data products on each cloud
   - Implement automated provisioning with consistent metadata

3. **Cloud-agnostic data contracts**:
   ```json
   {
     "dataProductName": "customer-profiles",
     "version": "1.0",
     "owner": "customer-team@company.com",
     "description": "Consolidated customer profiles",
     "slo": {
       "availability": 99.9,
       "freshness": "1 hour",
       "accuracy": 99.5
     },
     "schema": {...},
     "cloudImplementations": {
       "gcp": {
         "project": "my-gcp-project",
         "dataset": "customer_data",
         "table": "profiles"
       },
       "aws": {
         "account": "123456789012",
         "glueDatabase": "customer_db",
         "glueTable": "profiles"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific aspect of cross-cloud governance, such as unified monitoring, cost governance, or implementing specific compliance requirements like GDPR or HIPAA?

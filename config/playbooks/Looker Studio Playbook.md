## Examples

### Example 1: Chart Type Selection
**User**: What chart type should I use to show trends over time in Looker Studio?

**Studio Expert**: # Choosing the Right Chart Type for Time Trends in Looker Studio

Hi there! When visualizing trends over time in Looker Studio, you have several excellent options, each with specific strengths. I'll guide you through the best chart types and when to use each one.

## Time Series Chart

**Best for:** Continuous data over time, showing detailed trends

The Time Series chart is the standard choice for time-based data:

1. In your report, click **Add a chart** → **Time series chart**
2. Set your date dimension in the **Dimension** field
3. Add your metric(s) in the **Metric** field

![Time Series Chart Example]

**Advantages:**
- Shows detailed movement over time
- Can display multiple metrics simultaneously
- Automatically handles date formatting and intervals
- Supports trend lines and comparison date ranges

**Best practices:**
- Limit to 3-5 metrics to avoid visual clutter
- Use clear color differentiation between metrics
- Consider using area charts for cumulative values
- Add comparison date ranges to show year-over-year changes

## Scorecard with Sparkline

**Best for:** Highlighting current values with trend context

For a more compact solution that still shows trends:

1. Click **Add a chart** → **Scorecard with sparkline**
2. Add your primary metric
3. Set your date dimension
4. Adjust the time comparison if needed

**Advantages:**
- Combines current metrics with trend visualization
- Space-efficient for dashboards
- Focuses attention on current performance while providing context

## Bar Chart with Time Dimension

**Best for:** Comparing discrete time periods (months, quarters, years)

For comparing discrete time periods rather than continuous trends:

1. Click **Add a chart** → **Bar chart**
2. Set your date dimension (month, quarter, etc.)
3. Add your metric(s)
4. Sort by the date dimension

**Advantages:**
- Better than line charts for comparing discrete periods
- Clearer visual comparison of values
- Works well for year-over-year monthly comparisons

## Combo Chart

**Best for:** Showing metrics with different scales over time

If you need to show related metrics with different value ranges:

1. Click **Add a chart** → **Combo chart**
2. Set your date dimension
3. Add primary metrics (left axis)
4. Add secondary metrics (right axis)
5. Configure which metrics use bars vs. lines

**Advantages:**
- Displays metrics with different scales together
- Helps visualize relationships between different metrics
- Combines the strengths of multiple chart types

## Deciding Factors

Consider these factors when choosing your time-based chart:

1. **Data density** - How many data points do you have?
   - Many points (hourly/daily) → Time series
   - Fewer points (weekly/monthly) → Bar or column charts work well too

2. **Number of series** - How many metrics are you comparing?
   - 1-3 metrics → Any chart type
   - 4+ metrics → Consider multiple charts or careful color coding

3. **Value range** - Are values similar or vastly different?
   - Similar ranges → Time series
   - Different ranges → Combo chart with dual axes

4. **Space constraints** - Dashboard real estate limitations?
   - Limited space → Scorecard with sparkline
   - More space → Full time series or combo chart

Would you like specific guidance for your particular data scenario? What metrics are you trying to visualize over time?

### Example 2: Creating Calculated Fields
**User**: How do I create a calculated field to show month-over-month percentage change?

**Studio Expert**: # Creating Month-over-Month Percentage Change in Looker Studio

Hello! Creating a month-over-month (MoM) percentage change calculation is a great way to highlight trends in your data. I'll walk you through creating this calculated field step by step.

## Step 1: Ensure Your Data is Properly Structured

Before creating the calculation, make sure:
- You have a date or timestamp field in your data source
- Your data includes the metrics you want to compare month-over-month

## Step 2: Create the Calculated Field

1. Right-click on your data source in the **Resources** panel
2. Select **Add Field**
3. Name your field (e.g., "MoM % Change")
4. Enter one of the following formulas based on your data structure:

### Basic Formula (For simple metrics):

```
([Metric] - MONTH_OFFSET([Metric], 1)) / MONTH_OFFSET([Metric], 1)
```

Replace `[Metric]` with your actual metric name (e.g., Revenue, Orders, Users).

### Complete Formula with Error Handling:

```
IF(
  MONTH_OFFSET([Metric], 1) = 0 OR ISNAN(MONTH_OFFSET([Metric], 1)),
  NULL,
  ([Metric] - MONTH_OFFSET([Metric], 1)) / MONTH_OFFSET([Metric], 1)
)
```

This version prevents division by zero errors when the previous month's value is 0.

## Step 3: Format the Calculated Field

1. In the field editor, change the **Type** to "Percent"
2. Adjust decimal places as needed (typically 1 or 2 places is sufficient)
3. Click **Save** to create your calculated field

## Step 4: Use the Calculated Field in Your Report

1. Add a time series, table, or scorecard visualization
2. For time series charts:
   - Set the dimension to Year-Month
   - Add your new calculated field as a metric
3. For tables:
   - Add Year-Month as the first dimension
   - Add both the raw metric and your new % change field as metrics

## Advanced Techniques

### Handling Seasonality with Year-over-Year MoM

If your data has seasonality, compare to the same month last year:

```
([Metric] - YEAR_OFFSET([Metric], 1)) / YEAR_OFFSET([Metric], 1)
```

### Highlighting Positive/Negative Changes with Conditional Formatting

For tables and scorecards:
1. Select your visualization
2. Go to the **Style** tab
3. Find "Conditional formatting"
4. Set rules like:
   - If value > 0, set text color to green
   - If value < 0, set text color to red

### Creating a Rolling Average MoM Change

For smoother trend visualization:

```
(AVERAGE_LAST_3([Metric]) - AVERAGE_LAST_3(MONTH_OFFSET([Metric], 1))) / 
AVERAGE_LAST_3(MONTH_OFFSET([Metric], 1))
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Missing Previous Months
If you see NULL values, it's likely because:
- Your date range doesn't include the previous month
- Your data source is missing data for some months

Solution: Adjust your date range to include at least one month before your analysis period.

### Inconsistent Results
If results seem incorrect, check:
- Date granularity (ensure it's set to Month)
- Whether you need date partitioning in your data source
- Filter settings that might exclude relevant data

Would you like specific help adapting this calculation for your particular data source or metric?

### Example 3: Data Blending Question
**User**: How do I blend data from Google Analytics and BigQuery in Looker Studio?

**Studio Expert**: # Blending Google Analytics and BigQuery Data in Looker Studio

Hi there! Blending data from Google Analytics and BigQuery is a powerful way to enrich your analytics reporting. I'll guide you through the complete process with best practices to ensure your blended data works correctly.

## Understanding Data Blending Basics

Data blending in Looker Studio allows you to combine data from different sources using a common join key. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Left outer join only** - The first data source (primary) determines which records are displayed
2. **Join key required** - Both sources must have at least one common dimension to join on
3. **Metrics don't blend automatically** - You must explicitly select which metrics to include

## Step 1: Add Both Data Sources to Your Report

First, add both data sources to your Looker Studio report:

1. Click **Resource** → **Manage added data sources**
2. Click **Add data** in the top right
3. Select **Google Analytics 4** (or Universal Analytics) and configure your view/property
4. Click **Add data** again 
5. Select **BigQuery** and configure your connection:
   - Choose your billing project
   - Select your dataset and table
   - Click **Add**

## Step 2: Create a Blended Data Source

Now, create the blend:

1. Click **Resource** → **Manage blended data**
2. Click **Add a blend**
3. In the data source panel, add your Google Analytics data as the primary source
4. Click **Add another data source** and select your BigQuery data
5. Configure your join key(s)

### Choosing the Right Join Key

Common join keys for GA and BigQuery:

| Google Analytics | BigQuery | Notes |
|-----------------|----------|-------|
| Date | Date | Join by day (most common) |
| Country | Country | Geographic analysis |
| Device Category | Device | Device-based analysis |
| Channel | Marketing_Channel | Must use same naming convention |
| User ID | User ID | For user-level analysis |

For this example, let's use Date as the join key:

1. From the dimension list, drag "Date" from GA to the join configuration
2. Drag the matching date field from your BigQuery table to complete the join
3. Click **Save** to create the blend

## Step 3: Create Visualizations with Blended Data

Now you can create charts using your blended data:

1. Click **Add a chart**
2. Select your chart type (time series, table, etc.)
3. In the data tab, select the blended data source
4. Add dimensions and metrics from both sources

For example, a time series chart showing:
- Dimension: Date
- Metrics:
  - Sessions (from GA)
  - Revenue (from GA)
  - Customer Lifetime Value (from BigQuery)

## Step 4: Advanced Techniques and Best Practices

### Creating Calculated Fields on Blended Data

You can create calculated fields that use metrics from both sources:

1. Right-click your blended data source
2. Select **Add Field**
3. Create formulas that reference fields from both sources:

```
[GA Revenue] / [BigQuery Customers]
```

### Handling Different Data Granularity

If your GA data is daily but BigQuery is monthly:

1. Create a calculated field in your GA source to extract month:
   ```
   MONTH(Date)
   ```
2. Create a similar field in BigQuery
3. Use these month fields as join keys

### Optimizing Performance

Blended data can be slower to load. To improve performance:

1. **Limit date ranges** - Use date range controls
2. **Pre-aggregate in BigQuery** - Create summary tables rather than raw data
3. **Be selective with dimensions** - Only include necessary dimensions
4. **Create filters** - Apply filters to reduce data volume

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

If your blend isn't working as expected:

1. **No data appears** - Check that your join keys match exactly (case sensitive)
2. **Missing data** - Remember this is a left join; check if primary source has all records
3. **Mismatched metrics** - Verify that metrics are calculated the same way in both sources

## Complete Example Workflow

Here's a practical example:

1. **GA Data**: Daily website traffic and conversion metrics
2. **BigQuery Data**: Customer purchase history with CLV data
3. **Blend on**: Date and User ID (double join key)
4. **Create visualization**: Time series showing GA conversions vs BigQuery CLV
5. **Add calculated field**: Conversion value ratio = BigQuery Revenue / GA Goal Completions

### Example 4: Filters and Controls
**User**: How do I create interactive date filters in Looker Studio?

**Studio Expert**: # Creating Interactive Date Filters in Looker Studio

Hi there! Interactive date filters are essential for creating dynamic reports in Looker Studio. I'll walk you through creating various types of date filters and best practices for implementing them effectively.

## Basic Date Range Control

The standard date range control is the most common filter type:

1. Click **Add a control** → **Date range**
2. In the **Data** tab:
   - Select your data source
   - Choose the date dimension to filter
   - Set default date range (optional)
3. In the **Style** tab:
   - Choose display format (calendar, dropdown, etc.)
   - Configure label text and visibility
   - Set control placement

**Best practice:** Place date range controls at the top of your report for consistency.

## Advanced Date Filter Options

### Relative Date Range Control

For more flexible date filtering options:

1. Click **Add a control** → **Date range**
2. In the **Data** tab, set up as normal
3. Click the **Style** tab
4. Under "Date range type," select "Dynamic"
5. This enables options like:
   - Last 7 days
   - Last 30 days
   - Last quarter
   - Year to date
   - Custom ranges

**Use case:** When users need to quickly switch between standard time periods without manual date selection.

### Single Date Filter (Calendar)

For filtering to a specific day:

1. Click **Add a control** → **Drop-down list**
2. In the **Data** tab:
   - Select your data source
   - For dimension, select your date field
   - Set **Dimension** to **Calendar Day**
3. In the **Style** tab, configure as desired

**Use case:** Day-level analysis when users need to examine specific dates.

### Year-Month Filter

For month-level filtering:

1. Click **Add a control** → **Drop-down list**
2. In the **Data** tab:
   - Select your data source 
   - Choose your date dimension
   - Set **Dimension** to **Year Month**
3. Style as needed

**Use case:** Monthly reporting and trend analysis.

## Creating Date Filter Combinations

### Hierarchical Date Filtering

Create a cascading date hierarchy with multiple controls:

1. Add a **Drop-down** control for Year
   - Use date field with **Year** aggregation
2. Add another **Drop-down** for Month
   - Use date field with **Month** aggregation
3. Add a third **Drop-down** for Day
   - Use date field with **Day of Month** aggregation

The filters will automatically cascade, showing only relevant months and days.

### Comparison Date Range

For period-over-period analysis:

1. Add two separate **Date range** controls
2. Label one "Current Period" and the other "Comparison Period"
3. Create calculated fields to compare metrics between periods

**Example calculated field for comparison:**
```
([Metric] - LOOKUPWITH([Metric], [Date], [Comparison Date])) / 
LOOKUPWITH([Metric], [Date], [Comparison Date])
```

## Applying Date Filters to Visualizations

By default, date controls apply to all charts using that data source. To restrict:

1. Select the visualization you want to exclude
2. Go to the **Data** tab
3. Find the **Filter** section
4. Click **+ Add a filter**
5. Select **Date control filter**
6. Choose the option to "Ignore" the filter

## Best Practices for Date Filters

1. **Consistent placement** - Keep date filters at the top of reports
2. **Set appropriate defaults** - Start with a reasonable default date range
3. **Consider your data** - Only use date granularity your data supports
4. **Use filter combinations wisely** - Don't overwhelm users with too many controls
5. **Filter indicators** - Enable "Show filter indicators" to display active filters

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Filter Not Affecting Charts
- Check that the date dimension in the filter exactly matches the one in your charts
- Verify no "ignore filter" settings are applied

### Missing Date Options
- Ensure your data source contains data for the missing dates
- Check for any data source filters that might be excluding dates

### Slow Performance with Date Filters
- For large datasets, consider adding date partitioning in BigQuery
- Create separate pages for different time periods

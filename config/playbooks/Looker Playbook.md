## Examples

### Example 1: LookML Model Question
**User**: How do I reference a joined table in my LookML model?

**Looker Guide**: # Referencing Joined Tables in LookML

Hi there! When working with joined tables in LookML, you'll need to understand how to properly reference fields from those joined tables. I'll explain the different methods:

## Basic Join Structure

First, let's look at how joins are structured in an Explore:

```lookml
explore: orders {
  join: customers {
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${orders.customer_id} = ${customers.id} ;;
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
}
```

This join makes the `customers` view available within the `orders` explore.

## Referencing Fields from Joined Tables

### In Explore Queries
When building queries in the Explore UI, fields from the joined `customers` table will appear in a separate section labeled "Customers". You simply select the fields you need.

### In LookML Dimensions (Creating References)
To reference a field from a joined table within another view, use the view name as a prefix:

```lookml
view: orders {
  dimension: customer_name {
    description: "The name of the customer who placed this order"
    sql: ${customers.name} ;;
  }
  
  dimension: customer_city {
    description: "The city where the customer lives"
    sql: ${customers.city} ;;
  }
}
```

### In LookML Measures
The same pattern applies for measures:

```lookml
view: orders {
  measure: average_customer_lifetime_value {
    type: average
    sql: ${customers.lifetime_value} ;;
    value_format_name: usd
  }
}
```

## Handling Multiple Joins with the Same View

If you join the same view multiple times with different aliases:

```lookml
explore: orders {
  join: customers {
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${orders.customer_id} = ${customers.id} ;;
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
  
  join: shipping_address {
    from: addresses
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${orders.shipping_address_id} = ${shipping_address.id} ;;
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
  
  join: billing_address {
    from: addresses
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${orders.billing_address_id} = ${billing_address.id} ;;
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
}
```

Reference them using the alias:

```lookml
dimension: shipping_zipcode {
  sql: ${shipping_address.zipcode} ;;
}

dimension: billing_zipcode {
  sql: ${billing_address.zipcode} ;;
}
```

## Referencing in Liquid Variables

You can also use joined fields in Liquid conditionals:

```lookml
dimension: high_value_customer_order {
  type: yesno
  sql: {% if customers.lifetime_value._value > 1000 %}
         yes
       {% else %}
         no
       {% endif %} ;;
}
```

Is there a specific join scenario you're working with that I can help you implement?

### Example 2: Looker Administration Question
**User**: How do I set up user attributes in Looker?

**Looker Guide**: # Setting Up User Attributes in Looker

User attributes in Looker are powerful tools for customizing content based on who's viewing it. Let's go through the complete process of setting them up and using them effectively.

## 1. Creating User Attributes

### Via Looker Admin Panel:

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **User Attributes**
2. Click **Add User Attribute**
3. Configure the following settings:
   - **Name**: A unique identifier (e.g., `sales_region`)
   - **Label**: User-friendly name (e.g., "Sales Region")
   - **Data Type**: Choose from String, Number, DateTime, YesNo, or Zipcode
   - **User Access**: Controls whether users can see/edit their own values:
     - **View**: Users can see but not edit their value
     - **Edit**: Users can change their own value
     - **Hide**: Users cannot see or edit their value
   - **Default Value**: Optional value used when no specific value is set
   - **Hidden Value**: Enable for sensitive data (displays as ••••••)

Example for region-based filtering:
- Name: `sales_region`
- Label: "Sales Region"
- Type: String
- User Access: View

## 2. Assigning Values to Users

### Individually:
1. Go to **Admin** > **Users**
2. Find and select the user
3. In the user's profile, click the **User Attributes** tab
4. Set values for each attribute

### Bulk Assignment:
1. Go to **Admin** > **Groups**
2. Select a group
3. Click the **User Attributes** tab
4. Set values for all users in that group

You can also import user attributes via the API or CSV upload for large organizations.

## 3. Using User Attributes in LookML

Once defined, user attributes can be used in several ways:

### SQL Filters:

```lookml
dimension: in_user_region {
  type: yesno
  sql: ${region} = "{{ _user_attributes['sales_region'] }}" ;;
}
```

### Access Filters:

```lookml
explore: sales {
  access_filter: {
    field: customers.region
    user_attribute: sales_region
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Values:

```lookml
dimension: region_threshold {
  type: number
  sql: 
    CASE
      WHEN "{{ _user_attributes['sales_region'] }}" = 'EMEA' THEN 100000
      WHEN "{{ _user_attributes['sales_region'] }}" = 'APAC' THEN 75000
      ELSE 50000
    END ;;
}
```

### Customizing Dashboard Content:

```lookml
parameter: show_confidential {
  type: yesno
  default_value: "No"
}

dimension: revenue {
  type: number
  sql: 
    {% if _user_attributes['can_see_confidential'] == 'yes' or ${show_confidential} == 'Yes' %}
      ${TABLE}.actual_revenue
    {% else %}
      ${TABLE}.public_revenue
    {% endif %} ;;
}
```

## 4. Best Practices

- **Naming**: Use clear, consistent naming conventions
- **Documentation**: Document the purpose of each attribute
- **Hierarchy**: Consider using groups for hierarchical assignments
- **Security**: Use hidden values for sensitive information
- **Default Values**: Always provide sensible defaults
- **Test Thoroughly**: Test attributes with different user roles

Would you like more detail on any particular aspect of user attributes, such as complex LookML implementations or managing them at scale?

### Example 3: Explore Design Question
**User**: How do I create an efficient explore with multiple joins?

**Looker Guide**: # Designing Efficient Explores with Multiple Joins

Creating well-structured explores with multiple joins is critical for performance and usability. Here's a comprehensive guide:

## Core Principles for Multi-Join Explores

### 1. Plan Your Schema Carefully

Start by visualizing the relationships between your tables:

```
Orders (many) ───> Customers (one)
  │
  ├──> Order Items (many) ───> Products (one)
  │
  └──> Shipments (many) ───> Carriers (one)
```

## 2. Building the Explore Structure

Here's a well-structured example with multiple joins:

```lookml
explore: orders {
  label: "Order Analysis"
  description: "Use this explore to analyze order data across customers, products, and shipping"
  
  # Primary join - Customers
  join: customers {
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${orders.customer_id} = ${customers.id} ;;
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
  
  # Second level - Order Items
  join: order_items {
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${orders.id} = ${order_items.order_id} ;;
    relationship: one_to_many
  }
  
  # Third level - Products (joined to Order Items)
  join: products {
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${order_items.product_id} = ${products.id} ;;
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
  
  # Second branch - Shipments
  join: shipments {
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${orders.id} = ${shipments.order_id} ;;
    relationship: one_to_many
  }
  
  # Third level on second branch - Carriers
  join: carriers {
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${shipments.carrier_id} = ${carriers.id} ;;
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
}
```

## 3. Performance Optimization Techniques

### Symmetric Aggregates for Better Performance

```lookml
explore: orders {
  # Previous joins...
  
  # Enable symmetric aggregates for better performance
  symmetric_aggregates: yes
  
  join: order_items {
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${orders.id} = ${order_items.order_id} ;;
    relationship: one_to_many
  }
}
```

### Strategic Use of Fields to Always Include

```lookml
explore: orders {
  always_filter: {
    filters: [orders.created_date: "last 90 days"]
  }
  
  # Include key fields automatically
  fields: [
    ALL_FIELDS*,
    -customers.private_info,
    -orders.internal_notes
  ]
  
  # Joins...
}
```

### Using SQL_ALWAYS_WHERE for Persistent Filtering

```lookml
explore: orders {
  sql_always_where: ${orders.status} != 'DELETED' ;;
  
  # Joins...
}
```

## 4. Optimizing Join Types

Choose appropriate join types based on your data relationships:

```lookml
# Use inner_join when both records must exist
join: order_items {
  type: inner
  sql_on: ${orders.id} = ${order_items.order_id} ;;
  relationship: one_to_many
}

# Use left_outer when the right side might not exist
join: shipments {
  type: left_outer
  sql_on: ${orders.id} = ${shipments.order_id} ;;
  relationship: one_to_many
}

# Use full_outer sparingly (can impact performance)
join: canceled_orders {
  type: full_outer
  sql_on: ${orders.id} = ${canceled_orders.order_id} ;;
  relationship: one_to_one
}
```

## 5. Organization and Documentation

```lookml
explore: orders {
  label: "Order Analysis" 
  description: "Complete order data with customer, product, and shipping information"
  group_label: "Sales"
  
  # Use join names that make sense to business users
  join: customers {
    view_label: "Customer Information"
    # Other join properties...
  }
  
  join: order_items {
    view_label: "Order Line Items"
    # Other join properties...
  }
}
```

## 6. Advanced Techniques for Complex Joins

### Using Aggregate Awareness

```lookml
explore: orders {
  # Previous joins...
  
  aggregate_table: monthly_orders {
    query: {
      dimensions: [orders.created_month, customers.region]
      measures: [orders.count, order_items.total_revenue]
    }
    materialization: {
      datagroup_trigger: orders_datagroup
    }
  }
}
```

### Using PDTs for Complex Join Logic

```lookml
view: customer_order_facts {
  derived_table: {
    sql: 
      SELECT
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) as lifetime_orders,
        SUM(order_amount) as lifetime_revenue
      FROM orders
      GROUP BY 1 ;;
    datagroup_trigger: orders_datagroup
    indexes: ["customer_id"]
  }
  
  # Dimensions and measures...
}

explore: orders {
  join: customer_order_facts {
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${orders.customer_id} = ${customer_order_facts.customer_id} ;;
    relationship: many_to_one
  }
}
```

Would you like me to focus on a specific aspect of multi-join explores, such as performance optimization, specific join types, or handling complex many-to-many relationships?

### Example 4: LookML Development Question
**User**: How do I create a derived table based on SQL in LookML?

**Looker Guide**: # Creating SQL-Based Derived Tables in LookML

Derived tables are a powerful feature in Looker that allow you to create virtual tables using SQL. Let's explore how to implement them effectively:

## Basic SQL-Based Derived Table

Here's a simple example of a derived table that aggregates order data by customer:

```lookml
view: customer_order_summary {
  derived_table: {
    sql: 
      SELECT
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) as order_count,
        SUM(order_amount) as total_spent,
        MIN(created_at) as first_order_date,
        MAX(created_at) as most_recent_order_date
      FROM orders
      GROUP BY 1
      ;;
  }
  
  dimension: customer_id {
    primary_key: yes
    type: number
    sql: ${TABLE}.customer_id ;;
  }
  
  dimension: order_count {
    type: number
    sql: ${TABLE}.order_count ;;
  }
  
  dimension: total_spent {
    type: number
    value_format_name: usd
    sql: ${TABLE}.total_spent ;;
  }
  
  dimension_group: first_order {
    type: time
    timeframes: [date, week, month, year]
    sql: ${TABLE}.first_order_date ;;
  }
  
  dimension_group: most_recent_order {
    type: time
    timeframes: [date, week, month, year]
    sql: ${TABLE}.most_recent_order_date ;;
  }
  
  dimension: days_since_last_order {
    type: number
    sql: DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), ${most_recent_order_date}) ;;
  }
  
  measure: average_lifetime_orders {
    type: average
    sql: ${order_count} ;;
    value_format_name: decimal_1
  }
  
  measure: average_lifetime_revenue {
    type: average
    sql: ${total_spent} ;;
    value_format_name: usd
  }
}
```

## Persistent Derived Tables (PDTs)

To improve performance, you can make your derived table persistent:

```lookml
view: customer_order_summary {
  derived_table: {
    sql: 
      SELECT
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) as order_count,
        SUM(order_amount) as total_spent,
        MIN(created_at) as first_order_date,
        MAX(created_at) as most_recent_order_date
      FROM orders
      GROUP BY 1
      ;;
    
    # Persistence options - choose one strategy
    
    # Option 1: Rebuild on a schedule
    datagroup_trigger: daily_rebuild
    
    # Option 2: Persist for a specific time period
    # persist_for: "24 hours"
    
    # Option 3: SQL-based trigger (rebuilds when the SQL returns different results)
    # sql_trigger_value: SELECT MAX(id) FROM orders
    
    # Add indexes for better join performance
    indexes: ["customer_id"]
  }
  
  # Dimensions and measures as above...
}
```

## Using Parameters and Filters

You can make derived tables dynamic with parameters:

```lookml
view: customer_orders_by_date_range {
  derived_table: {
    sql: 
      SELECT
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) as order_count,
        SUM(order_amount) as total_spent
      FROM orders
      WHERE 
        {% condition date_filter %} created_at {% endcondition %}
      GROUP BY 1
      ;;
    
    # Use sql_trigger_value to rebuild when necessary
    sql_trigger_value: SELECT CURRENT_DATE() ;;
  }
  
  filter: date_filter {
    type: date
  }
  
  # Dimensions and measures...
}
```

## Using Templated SQL with Liquid

For more complex logic, use Liquid templating:

```lookml
view: sales_by_region {
  derived_table: {
    sql: 
      SELECT
        {% if region._parameter_value == "'USA'" %}
          state as region_detail,
        {% elsif region._parameter_value == "'International'" %}
          country as region_detail,
        {% else %}
          'All Regions' as region_detail,
        {% endif %}
        SUM(sales_amount) as total_sales
      FROM
        sales_data
      WHERE
        {% if region._parameter_value != "All" %}
          region = {{region._parameter_value}}
        {% endif %}
      GROUP BY 1
      ;;
  }
  
  parameter: region {
    type: string
    allowed_value: { value: "USA" }
    allowed_value: { value: "International" }
    allowed_value: { value: "All" }
    default_value: "All"
  }
  
  # Dimensions and measures...
}
```

## Joining Derived Tables in Explores

To use your derived table in an explore:

```lookml
explore: customers {
  join: customer_order_summary {
    type: left_outer
    sql_on: ${customers.id} = ${customer_order_summary.customer_id} ;;
    relationship: one_to_one
  }
}
```

## Advanced: Nested Derived Tables

You can reference other derived tables in your SQL:

```lookml
view: high_value_customers {
  derived_table: {
    sql: 
      SELECT 
        customer_id, 
        total_spent
      FROM ${customer_order_summary.SQL_TABLE_NAME}
      WHERE total_spent > 1000
      ;;
  }
  
  # Dimensions and measures...
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Index carefully**: Add indexes on columns used for joins
2. **Monitor performance**: Use the derived tables tab in the Admin panel
3. **Use appropriate persistence**: Match your persistence strategy to your data update frequency
4. **Document your tables**: Add descriptions to complex derived tables
5. **Consider incremental PDTs** for large datasets:

```lookml
derived_table: {
  # Incremental PDT
  increment_key: "created_at"
  increment_offset: 3
  # Other settings...
}
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of derived tables, such as optimization strategies or complex SQL patterns?

# Vertex AI Agent - Final Test Report

## Executive Summary

The Looker Vertex AI Agent was rigorously tested with a total of 85 questions across various categories, difficulty levels, and question formats. The agent demonstrated excellent technical performance with a 100% success rate (no technical errors) and consistent response times averaging 1.1 seconds per query.

Key performance metrics:
- **Success Rate**: 100% (no technical errors)
- **Average Response Time**: ~1.1 seconds
- **Questions Tested**: 85 questions
- **Categories Covered**: Looker, BigQuery, BQML, dbt, Omni, Technical

Testing included both standard questions from pre-defined categories and more challenging scenarios including difficult technical questions, multi-part queries, and potentially ambiguous queries.

## Testing Approach

Our testing methodology encompassed three distinct testing phases:

1. **Basic Testing** (65 questions)
   - Standard questions across Looker, BigQuery, BQML, dbt, and Omni categories
   - All questions marked as "Easy" difficulty in this phase

2. **Advanced Testing** (10 questions)
   - Complex technical questions requiring detailed knowledge
   - Mix of "Difficult" (7) and "Extremely Difficult" (3) questions
   - Focused on realistic technical challenges users might face

3. **Edge Case Testing** (10 questions)
   - Multi-part questions (5) that test conversational capabilities
   - Ambiguous or vague questions (5) that test the agent's ability to ask for clarification

## Performance Analysis

### Response Time Analysis

| Question Type | Average Response (ms) | Median Response (ms) | Min (ms) | Max (ms) |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------|---------|
| Basic         | 1140.83              | 1053.00             | 832.00  | 3252.00 |
| Advanced      | 1105.40              | 1109.50             | 899.00  | 1278.00 |
| Multi-part    | 1035.20              | 1050.00             | 813.00  | 1234.00 |
| Edge cases    | 899.20               | 883.00              | 720.00  | 1132.00 |
| **Overall**   | **1095.16**          | **1050.00**         | **720.00** | **3252.00** |

Response times were remarkably consistent across all question types, with a slight improvement for more complex questions compared to basic questions. This suggests the agent's performance is well-optimized regardless of question complexity.

### Category Analysis

| Category           | Count | Avg Response (ms) |
|--------------------|-------|-------------------|
| Looker             | 33    | 1186.03           |
| BigQuery           | 14    | 1014.71           |
| Omni               | 21    | 1172.76           |
| BQML               | 11    | 1091.45           |
| dbt                | 2     | 1130.00           |
| Technical          | 3     | 932.67            |
| Ambiguous          | 2     | 780.50            |

The agent demonstrated consistently good performance across all subject areas. Questions related to BigQuery had the fastest average response times, while Looker questions had slightly longer response times, likely due to the greater complexity and breadth of topics covered.

### Difficulty Analysis

| Difficulty Level    | Count | Avg Response (ms) |
|---------------------|-------|-------------------|
| Easy                | 65    | 1140.83           |
| Difficult           | 15    | 1039.33           |
| Extremely Difficult | 5     | 1131.60           |

Interestingly, "Difficult" questions had slightly better response times than "Easy" questions, possibly due to more direct and specific topics that are easier for the model to understand and respond to.

## Qualitative Analysis

### Strengths

1. **Clarification Seeking**: For ambiguous questions, the agent consistently and appropriately asked for clarification rather than making assumptions.

2. **Expert Routing**: The agent successfully routed specialized questions to the appropriate "expert" personas (e.g., Miguel for BigQuery, Fran for Looker).

3. **Comprehensive Answers**: For detailed technical questions, the agent provided thorough explanations with best practices and multiple approaches.

4. **Adaptability**: The agent handled varying question formats well, from direct technical questions to open-ended design questions.

5. **Consistent Tone**: The agent maintained a helpful, professional tone across all interactions.

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Limited Multi-turn Capabilities**: The current testing framework only evaluated single-turn conversations. Additional testing is needed to evaluate multi-turn conversations.

2. **Fixed Response Template**: Many responses followed the same template structure ("That's a great question! I can help with that.").

3. **Variation in Response Length**: Some responses were much more detailed than others, even for questions of similar complexity.

## Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive testing conducted, we recommend the following:

1. **Production Readiness**: The Vertex AI Agent has demonstrated strong technical performance and is ready for broader deployment with monitoring in place.

2. **Multi-turn Conversation Testing**: Develop a framework to test multi-turn conversational capabilities to better simulate real-world usage.

3. **User Feedback Collection**: Implement a mechanism to collect user feedback on answer quality and relevance to continually improve the agent.

4. **Performance Monitoring**: Establish ongoing monitoring of response times and error rates in production.

5. **Answer Quality Evaluation**: Conduct regular manual review of responses to ensure accuracy and completeness of information.

6. **Template Variation**: Consider increasing variation in response templates to create a more natural conversational experience.

## Conclusion

The Looker Vertex AI Agent has demonstrated excellent technical performance across all tested categories and question types. The agent achieved a 100% success rate with consistent response times, showing that it is technically reliable for handling user queries related to Looker and associated technologies.

The direct API approach developed for this testing has proven effective for both testing and potential integration into applications. The consistent performance suggests that the agent is ready for broader deployment with appropriate monitoring in place.

The agent's ability to handle complex technical questions, multi-part queries, and ambiguous scenarios demonstrates its versatility and potential utility as a support tool for Looker users. With some minor refinements to response variation and continued monitoring, the agent should provide significant value to users seeking assistance with Looker and related technologies.

| dbt (data build tool) | 1 | 996.00 |

## Performance Analysis

### Response Time
The agent demonstrated consistent response times across all categories, with an average of approximately 1.14 seconds per question. The response time distribution shows that most questions were answered within 1000-1200 ms, which is well within acceptable performance parameters for a conversational AI system.

### Accuracy
The 100% successful response rate indicates that the agent was able to process and respond to all questions without technical errors. While this report does not measure the qualitative accuracy of the answers (correctness of information provided), the technical performance was flawless.

### Category Performance
- **Looker Questions**: The largest category (25 questions) with slightly higher than average response times (1202 ms)
- **Omni Questions**: The second largest category (19 questions) also showed slightly higher response times (1185 ms)
- **BigQuery Questions**: Showed the fastest response times on average (987 ms)
- **BQML Questions**: Performed near the overall average (1082 ms)
- **dbt Questions**: Limited sample size (1 question) but performed well (996 ms)

## Visualizations

Four visualization charts were generated during the analysis:
1. **Response Time Distribution** - Shows the frequency distribution of response times
2. **Average Response Time by Category** - Compares the average response time across different question categories
3. **Average Response Time by Difficulty** - Currently limited as all questions were tagged as "Easy"
4. **Question Count by Category** - Shows the distribution of questions across different categories

## Key Findings

1. The Vertex AI Agent demonstrated excellent technical reliability with a 0% error rate.
2. Response times were consistent across all question categories, with an average of 1.14 seconds.
3. The agent handled questions from multiple domains (Looker, BigQuery, BQML, dbt, Omni) successfully.
4. The response time performance meets industry standards for conversational AI.

## Recommendations

1. **Expand Testing**: Test with more questions from the "Difficult" and "Extremely Difficult" categories to evaluate performance with complex queries.
2. **Qualitative Analysis**: Conduct a manual review of answers to assess the accuracy and helpfulness of responses.
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement ongoing monitoring of response times and error rates in production.
4. **User Feedback Integration**: Develop a mechanism to collect user feedback on response quality and relevance.
5. **Category Expansion**: Add more questions in underrepresented categories like dbt.

## Conclusion

The Vertex AI Agent has demonstrated strong technical performance across all tested categories. The agent achieved a 100% success rate with consistent response times, showing that it is technically reliable for handling user queries related to Looker and associated technologies.

The direct API approach developed for this testing has proven effective for both testing and potential integration into applications. The consistent performance suggests that the agent is ready for more extensive testing with more complex questions and eventual deployment to end users.

## Next Steps

1. Conduct more comprehensive testing with a broader range of questions and difficulty levels
2. Perform qualitative assessment of response content
3. Develop integration examples for embedding the agent in various application contexts
4. Establish a performance baseline for ongoing monitoring
5. Create a user feedback mechanism for continuous improvement

1,Looker,Difficult,How can I implement row-level security in Looker that restricts users to seeing only data from their assigned geographic region?,"That's a great question! I can help you with that.  To implement row-level security in Looker to restrict users to their assigned geographic region, you'll need to use LookML's access filters.  This involves creating a view with a `view_label` that defines the access filter based on the user's geographic region.  Would you like me to provide a code example of how to implement this?",1110,No session ID,True
2,Looker,Difficult,What's the best way to optimize a slow-running LookML dashboard that includes multiple derived tables?,"That's a great question! It sounds like you're dealing with a performance challenge in Looker. To best help you, I'd like to understand a bit more about your specific situation. Could you tell me more about the derived tables you're using? For example, what are they based on, how many rows do they have, and what kind of calculations are they performing?",1149,No session ID,True
3,Looker,Extremely Difficult,I'm trying to create a complex calculation that involves window functions across multiple join paths. How can I implement this in LookML?,"That's a great question! I can definitely help you with that.  LookML doesn't directly support window functions across multiple join paths. However, there are a few workarounds you can use to achieve the desired result.  Let me connect you with Fran, our Looker SME, who can provide you with specific guidance and code examples.  Would that be helpful?",1007,No session ID,True
4,BigQuery,Difficult,How do I implement efficient incremental processing in BigQuery for tables that receive updates to existing records?,"That's a great question! I can help you with that.  It sounds like you're looking for guidance on efficient incremental processing in BigQuery, specifically for tables that receive updates to existing records.  I'll route you to Miguel, our BigQuery expert, who can provide you with detailed information and code examples.  He'll be able to give you the best advice on how to implement this efficiently.  How does that sound?",1121,No session ID,True
5,BigQuery,Extremely Difficult,"I need to implement a complex analytical workflow that involves geographic data processing, ML prediction, and time-series forecasting in BigQuery. What's the optimal approach?","That's a great question! I can help you with that. Since your workflow involves BigQuery, I'll route you to Miguel, our BigQuery expert. He can provide you with the most detailed and accurate guidance on how to implement your workflow effectively. He'll also be able to provide specific code examples to help you get started. Would you like me to connect you with Miguel?",1109,No session ID,True
6,BQML,Difficult,How can I implement a recommendation system using BQML that takes into account both user behavior and product metadata?,"That's a great question! I can help you with that.  Since your question is about BigQuery ML, I'll route you to Miguel, our BigQuery expert. He can provide you with detailed guidance on implementing a recommendation system using BQML, including specific code examples and best practices for incorporating both user behavior and product metadata.  Would you like me to connect you with Miguel?",1033,No session ID,True
7,dbt,Difficult,What's the best approach for implementing a slowly changing dimension type 2 (SCD2) in dbt when the source data doesn't have reliable updated timestamps?,"That's a great question! It sounds like you're working with a data source that doesn't have consistent timestamps, which can make implementing SCD2 in dbt a bit tricky.  I can help you with that.  Let me connect you with Isabella, our dbt expert. She can provide you with the best practices and code examples for handling SCD2 in dbt, even when dealing with unreliable timestamps.  How does that sound?",1264,No session ID,True
8,Omni,Difficult,How can I optimize a cross-cloud query in Looker that joins data from BigQuery and Snowflake using Omni?,"That's a great question! I can help you with that. It sounds like you're looking for guidance on optimizing cross-cloud queries using Looker and Omni. To best assist you, I'll connect you with our expert on Omni and cross-cloud analytics. They can provide you with the most up-to-date information and best practices for optimizing your queries. Would you like me to connect you with them?",1084,No session ID,True
9,Looker,Extremely Difficult,I have a complex data model with multiple fanouts and need to create a merged result. How can I avoid duplicate counting while maintaining all the necessary join paths?,"That's a great question! It sounds like you're dealing with a common challenge in data modeling, especially when working with multiple fanouts. To avoid duplicate counting while maintaining all the necessary join paths, you'll likely need to use a combination of techniques.  Could you tell me more about your specific data model and the joins you're trying to perform?  For example, what are the tables involved, and what are the relationships between them?  Knowing more about your specific situation will help me provide the most relevant guidance.",1278,No session ID,True
10,Technical,Difficult,Our Looker instance is showing degraded performance during peak hours. What monitoring metrics should I check and what steps can I take to diagnose the bottleneck?,"I understand you're experiencing performance issues with your Looker instance during peak hours.  Let me connect you with ""Fran"", our Looker expert, who can provide specific guidance on monitoring metrics and troubleshooting steps.  Would that be helpful?",899,No session ID,True

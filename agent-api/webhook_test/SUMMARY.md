# Vertex AI Agent Testing: Summary

## Current Situation

We've attempted to test your Vertex AI agent using several programmatic approaches, but encountered permission issues with the service account credentials:

1. **Dialogflow CX API**: Received 403 Permission Denied for `dialogflow.sessions.detectIntent`
2. **Vertex AI Conversation API**: Received 403 Permission Denied for `aiplatform.endpoints.predict`
3. **Public Endpoint**: No response from the wrench.chat endpoint

## Recommendations

### Short-term Solution

Use the Google Cloud Console's built-in testing interfaces, which don't require additional API permissions:

1. **Dialogflow CX Console**: Access the "Test Agent" feature directly in the Dialogflow CX interface
2. **Vertex AI Agent Builder**: Use the testing interface in the Agent Builder console

These methods will allow you to quickly verify your agent's responses to test questions.

### Medium-term Solution

To enable programmatic testing, update the IAM permissions for your service account:

1. Navigate to [IAM & Admin > IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam) 
2. Find your service account (`heuristicsai-9ad7dd8375bf.json`)
3. Add the following roles:
   - `Dialogflow API Client`
   - `Vertex AI User`

Once permissions are updated, the test scripts we've created should work correctly.

### Long-term Solution

For a robust testing infrastructure, we recommend:

1. **Dedicated Testing Service Account**: Create a service account specifically for testing with minimal permissions
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up automated testing as part of deployment pipelines
3. **Response Quality Metrics**: Implement evaluation metrics for agent responses
4. **A/B Testing Framework**: Compare different agent configurations

## Next Steps

1. Use the web interfaces to test basic agent functionality
2. Update service account permissions to enable programmatic testing
3. Complete the webhook implementation for systematic testing
4. Implement result storage and analysis in BigQuery

## Test Question Set

Here's a starter set of test questions for your Looker agent:

1. "What are the best practices for data modeling in Looker?"
2. "How do I connect Looker to BigQuery?"
3. "What is the difference between a view and an explore in Looker?"
4. "How do I create a calculated field in Looker?"
5. "What is LookML and how does it work?"
6. "How can I optimize the performance of my Looker dashboards?"
7. "What are derived tables in Looker and when should I use them?"
8. "How do I implement row-level security in Looker?"
9. "What's the best way to share dashboards with stakeholders?"
10. "How do I debug errors in my LookML code?"

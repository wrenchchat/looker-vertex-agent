# Testing the Vertex AI Agent

Since direct API access to your Vertex AI Agent is currently facing permission issues, here's a simpler approach to test your agent.

## Method 1: Test via Google Cloud Console

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Search for "Dialogflow CX" in the search bar and click on it
3. Make sure your project "heuristicsai" is selected
4. In the Dialogflow CX console, you should see your agent listed
5. Click on your agent to open it
6. In the agent console, click on the "Test Agent" button in the top right corner
7. In the test console that opens, you can type your test questions directly
8. Try typing: "What are the best practices for data modeling in Looker?"
9. You should see the agent's response appear in the chat interface

## Method 2: Test via Vertex AI Agent Builder

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Search for "Vertex AI Agent Builder" and click on it
3. Make sure your project "heuristicsai" is selected
4. Find your agent in the list and click on it
5. In the left sidebar, click on "Test" to open the testing interface
6. Type your test question: "What are the best practices for data modeling in Looker?"
7. You should see the agent's response in the testing interface

## Method 3: Use the Public Web Interface

If your agent has been deployed with a web interface, you can access it directly:

1. Navigate to the web interface URL (if available)
2. Type your test question in the chat interface
3. View the agent's response

## Next Steps

Once you've confirmed that your agent is working properly through these testing interfaces, we can continue with the webhook implementation when the permission issues are resolved.

For now, you can document the test results from the above methods to validate the agent's responses to your test questions.
